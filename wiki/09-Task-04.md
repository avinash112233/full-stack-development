Now that you know how to structure HTML elements, we’ll spend the rest of the lesson building an informational website using some of the most common HTML elements. We’ve put some elements in **brownBear.html** directory at current repository to get you started, but you’ll write the rest of the page on your own. From now, all the task will be exicuted in this file.

```
<body>
  <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
  <h2>About Brown Bears</h2>
  <h3>Species</h3>
  <h3>Features</h3>
</body>
```
1. Below the ```<h3>``` heading that says Features, add an ```<h2>``` heading that says Habitat.
2. Below the Habitat heading, add an ```<h3>``` heading that says Countries with Large Brown Bear Populations.
3. On the next line, add one more ```<h3>``` heading that says Countries with Small Brown Bear Populations.
4. Finally, on the next line add an ```<h2>``` heading that says Media.

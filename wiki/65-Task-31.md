1. Time to add some location. Users might get creative with what location they choose to put, so let’s use the ```<datalist>``` element.

   In ```<section>```  element with a class of ```"location-selection"```, we already have the ```<label>``` and 
   ```<input>``` set up. Add a ```<datalist>``` element with an ```id``` of ```"location"```.

2. Inside the ```<datalist>``` element, add 3 ```<option>```s.

* The first ```<option>``` should have a value of ```"India"```.
* The second ```<option>``` should have a value of ```"Russia"```.
* The third ```<option>``` can be a value that you choose and display text relevant to the value (make sure it’s not empty!)

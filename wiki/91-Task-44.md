1. Add the following video URL with the attribute ```controls``` and wrap it in an opening and closing video tag.
```
https://course-assets-workspace.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/html/catVideo.mp4
```
In between the opening and closing ```<video>``` tag, you can add a text that will show up if the video is unable to load. This text is helpful for screen readers as well!

2. Add the following gif into your code using the ```<embed>``` tag and the ```src``` attribute:
```
https://course-assets-workspace.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/html/cat.gif
```

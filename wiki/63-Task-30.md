1. Letâ€™s now give our users a choice of qualification using a dropdown list.

In ```<section>``` element with a ```class``` of ```"qualification"``` there is a ```<label>``` that we can associate a ```<select>``` element with.

Add a ```<select>``` element with a name of ```"qualification"``` and an ```id ```of ```"qualification"```.

2. Inside the ```<select>``` element, add 3 ```<option>```s.

* The second ```<option>``` should have a value of ```"Graduate"``` and display the text ```Graduate``` on the webpage.

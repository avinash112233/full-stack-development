HTML files also allow you to add comments to your code.

Comments begin with ```<!--``` and end with ```-->```. Any characters in between will be ignored by your browser.
```
<!-- This is a comment that the browser will not display. -->
```

Including comments in your code is helpful for many reasons:

1. They help you (and others) understand your code if you decide to come back and review it at a much later date.
2. They allow you to experiment with new code, without having to delete old code.
```
<!-- Favorite Films Section -->
<p>The following is a list of my favorite films:</p>
```

In this example, the comment is used to denote that the following text makes up a particular section of the page.
```
<!-- <p> Test Code </p> -->
```

In the example above, a valid HTML element (a paragraph element) has been “commented out.” This practice is useful when there is code you want to experiment with, or return to, in the future.

1. In the link that reads ```Learn More```, add the ```target``` attribute and set it equal to ```_blank```.

2. In **brownBear.html**, transform the image on your page into a link by wrapping the image element with an anchor element. Set the ```target``` attribute so that the link opens in a new window.

   Your image element should be a nested tag inside your anchor element.

   Use the same URL as before:

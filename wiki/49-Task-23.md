1. Create a seperate file named **form.html**.

2. In the **form.html**, add a ```<form>``` element. Assign the ```<form>``` with:
* an action attribute with a value of "/practice.html"
* a method attribute with a value of "POST"

3. Right now we have a blank ```<form>``` on a **form.html**, let’s add some context.

   Add an ```<h1>``` inside the ```<form>``` element with the text "Welcome to the Konfinity application!" between the 
   opening and closing ```<h1>``` tags.

4. Add **"Let’s get started by creating your account"** to the form by inserting a ```<p>``` element below the ```<h1>``` element.

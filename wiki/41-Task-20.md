1. Under the ```<h1>``` element that says ```The Brown Bear```, create an unordered list with the following three list items:

* Introduction
* Habitat
* Media

2. Wrap the text of each list item in the unordered list in an ```anchor``` element. Each anchor tag should link to the corresponding ```<div>``` on the page (The ```<a>``` element that contains the text “Introduction” links to ```#introduction```).
